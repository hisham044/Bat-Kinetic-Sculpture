# Bat-Kinetic-Sculpture
 Representation of a Bat avoiding obstacles while in flight.
## Form and Functionality of the Sculpture:
The sculpture contains a rotating bat with flapping wings and barriers that fall and rise around it. The bat's eyes are ultrasonic sensors, which detect obstacles that rise and fall with some delay one after the other. When the impediments are recognized, the bat rotates away from them while flapping its wings. The wings and obstacles are handled by servo motors, and the bat rotates by a dc motor. The bat, which has no connectivity to the outside of its box, communicates with the other esp32, which contains a dc motor, via an Arduino IoT cloud things connection.
